You can reproduce the structure bellow.</li> </ul> <pre><code>tf-project/\n\u251c\u2500 backend.tf\n\u251c\u2500 main.tf\n\u2514\u2500 providers.tf\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>The <code>backend.tf</code> file will contains the configuration of our S3 remote backend.</li> <li>The <code>main.tf</code> file will contains the configuration of our VPC.</li> <li>The <code>providers.tf</code> file will contains the configuration of the AWS provider.</li> </ul> <p>Step 2: Configure the S3 Remote Backend</p> <ul> <li>Add the S3 remote backend configuration on the <code>backend.tf</code> file.</li> </ul> backend.tf<pre><code>terraform {\nbackend \"s3\" {\nbucket         = \"terraform-state-&lt;account-id&gt;\" # (1)!\ndynamodb_table = \"terraform-state-lock\"\nencrypt        = true\nkey            = \"vpc/terraform.tfstate\"\nregion         = \"eu-west-1\"\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> Don't forget to replace <code>&lt;account-id&gt;</code> by your account ID.</li> </ol> <p>As you can see, we are using the S3 bucket and the DynamoDB table provisioned earlier to manage our Terraform backend.</p> <p>The <code>key</code> attribute will be the object name on the S3 bucket.</p> <p>Step 3: Configure the AWS Provider</p> <ul> <li>Add the AWS provider configuration on the <code>providers.tf</code> file.</li> </ul> providers.tf<pre><code>provider \"aws\" {}\n</code></pre> <p>The AWS provider configuration is get from the AWS CLI configuration so we don't need to overide it.</p> <p>Step 4: Define the VPC Configuration</p> <ul> <li>Define the VPC configuration on the <code>main.tf</code> file.</li> </ul> main.tf<pre><code>module \"vpc\" {\nsource  = \"terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws\"\nversion = \"5.1.2\"\nname = \"my-vpc\"\ncidr = \"10.0.0.0/16\"\nazs = [\"eu-west-1a\", \"eu-west-1b\"]\ndatabase_subnets    = [\"10.0.0.0/24\", \"10.0.1.0/24\"]\nprivate_subnets     = [\"10.0.10.0/24\", \"10.0.11.0/24\"]\npublic_subnets      = [\"10.0.100.0/24\", \"10.0.101.0/24\"]\nenable_nat_gateway = true\n}\n</code></pre> <p>To simplify the VPC configuration we will use a Terraform module developed by AWS. This module allow us to configure many ressources with few informations.</p> <p>Here we will deploy a VPC <code>my-vpc</code> with <code>10.0.0.0/16</code> as base CIDR block. On this VPC we will create 3 groups of 2 subnets with specific purpose.</p> <ul> <li>Database subnets will be used by database resources. The resources on these subnets cannot be accessed directly from internet.</li> <li>Private subnets will be used by any resource that is not a database or publicly accessible. The resources on these subnets cannot be accessed directly from internet.</li> <li>Public subnets will be used by any resource that can be publicly accessible. The resources on these subnets can be accessed from internet.</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>A public subnet is defined by its route table. If the default route of the attached route table redirect the traffic to an Internet Gateway the subnet is considered as public.</p> <p>A resource on a public subnet is not publicly accessible by default. You have to configure a security group that enable public access.</p> <p>Step 5: Initialize Your Terraform Project</p> <ul> <li>Open a terminal and navigate to the Terraform project</li> <li>Run <code>terraform init</code> to initialize the Terraform project and download necessary providers and modules.</li> </ul> <p>Step 6: Validate the Configuration</p> <ul> <li>Run <code>terraform validate</code> to validate the configuration.</li> </ul> <p>Step 7: Review and Deploy</p> <ul> <li>Run <code>terraform plan</code> to review the actions that Terraform will take.</li> <li>If the plan looks as expected, apply the configuration by executing <code>terraform apply</code>. You will be asked to type <code>yes</code> to confirm the deployment.</li> </ul> <p>Tip</p> <p>It's recommended to use <code>terraform plan -out=FILENAME</code> and <code>terraform apply FILENAME</code> to only make actions that have been displayed on the plan.</p> <p>Step 8: Confirm the Deployment</p> <p>Once the process is complete, you should see an output displaying the IDs and other details of the resources you've just created.</p> <p> Congratulations, you've successfully automated the deployment of a VPC and subnets in AWS using Terraform!
